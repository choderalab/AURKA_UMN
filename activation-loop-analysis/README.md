# Analysis of activation loop and other features for WT data

## Authors

John D. Chodera

This section contains analysis scripts and processed datafiles for the activation loop for WT kinase with and without phosphorylation and Tpx2

11428: AURKA mutants (1OL5 - with TPX2, phosphorylated THRs)
11429: AURKA mutants (1OL5 - without TPX2, phosphorylated THRs)


## Manifest

* `compute-distances.py` - compute various distances in parallel using multiprocessing
* `data/proj*-run*.npy` - numpy-format data files generated by `compute-distances.py`; data[clone] contains dict indexing data for that clone

* `Analysis.ipynb` - Jupyter notebook for analysis of distances

## Running `compute-distances.py`

Start a job on `hal`:
```bash
qsub -I -l walltime=04:00:00,nodes=1:ppn=12 -l mem=32G -q active
```
Run the script:
```bash
python compute-distances.py
```
