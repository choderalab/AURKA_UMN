ValueError: No template found for residue 164 (ARG).  The set of atoms matches ARG, but the bonds are different.

* I think this is due to missing internal bond CONECT entries
* correct manually in the 2 WT pdbs

CONECT 2710 2730
CONECT 2730 2710
CONECT 2739 2741
CONECT 2741 2739

No template found for residue 165 (TPO).  The set of atoms is similar to T1P, but it is missing 7 hydrogen atoms.
* this was fixed in myb somehow -- that might have been within leap though?
* had something to do with naming? or does pdbfixer need TPO.xml?

* typo in h-TPO.xml was putting a hydrogen on the wrong atom; corrected

Sunday June 5 2016
* was breaking on TPO: reran pdbfix.py, fine
* started exploding when pdbfixer was run withing the setup script before the
modeller.addHydrogens thing; moved that out front
* still seems to be hanging at taking steps; adding in writing out a pdf after
each individual step

* Crashed the first time -- rerunning and energies are way down (?)
* NaNing after 2 steps now instead of 1!
* perpetrators: TPO 288, ARG 255 (possibly others)
* minimizing puts the O2 from TPO 288 right on top of one of the Ns of ARG 255
-- why? why would minimizing allow that?
* trying to take a single step after each minimize -- set temp to temp/20?

* ok so the difference between the old pdbs and the new is that pdbfixer is
turning all HIS into double protonated right now?
* and also T1P = TPO and OG = OG1 (make these changes in old and see if it works)
* this seems to work now (or at least, energies are way lower) -- what happened 
to pdbfixer?

* MINIMIZE ERROR: TPOs not minimized correctly, somehow not taken into consideration, 
such that atoms end up overlapping either with each other or with other residues
